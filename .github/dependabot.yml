# Note: For Helm charts managed via Helmfile, manual version updates
# are required. Consider using Renovate bot for more comprehensive
# Helm chart dependency management.
#
# Helm chart versions should be explicitly pinned in:
# - helmfile/helmfile.yaml.gotmpl
# - helmfile/config/releases.yaml.gotmpl
# - helmfile/values/*.yaml
#
# Regular reviews recommended:
# - Weekly: Check for critical security updates
# - Monthly: Review and update all chart versions
# - Quarterly: Major version upgrades and testing
