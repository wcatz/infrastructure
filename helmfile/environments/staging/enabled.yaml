# ⚠️ SECURITY: Staging environment is DISABLED to mitigate risk
# Only production environment should be enabled in production deployments
# Staging can be enabled for pre-production testing when needed

# This file overrides the default enabled.yaml for the staging environment.
# Staging should closely mirror production setup for testing.

# Note: All keys should be explicitly defined to avoid parsing errors.
# If a service is not listed here, the default from config/enabled.yaml applies.
