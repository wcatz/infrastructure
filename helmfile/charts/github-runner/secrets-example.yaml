# Example secrets for GitHub Actions Runner
# These should be encrypted with SOPS in production

---
# GitHub runner registration token
# Get this from: https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/settings/actions/runners/new
# Or generate via GitHub API/CLI
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: github-runner-token
  namespace: github-runner
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # Replace with your actual GitHub runner registration token
  # This token expires after 1 hour, so you may want to use a PAT or GitHub App
  token: "YOUR_GITHUB_RUNNER_TOKEN_HERE"

  # Alternative: Use a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with 'repo' scope
  # This is more permanent but less secure than registration tokens
  # token: "ghp_YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE"

# Tailscale authentication key
# Get this from: https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: tailscale-auth
  namespace: github-runner
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # Replace with your Tailscale auth key
  # Make sure it's:
  # - Reusable: Yes
  # - Ephemeral: No (unless you want runners to disappear when pods restart)
  # - Tags: tag:k8s,tag:ci (for ACL management)
  authkey: "tskey-auth-YOUR_TAILSCALE_KEY_HERE"
